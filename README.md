# This is my entry for the 2016 hack.summit [Koding.com](http://koding.com) virtual hackathon.

Created this as an idea that other financial dashboards so-called are like using sledgehammers to hit a fly, and also inspired by [this podcast](https://www.bfm.my/rns-rajen-devadasen-using-financial-dashboards.html). This aims to be a very very dead simple way to track one's expenses for that month.


## Usage

* Please browse to the hackathon URL that was given in the submission form.
* Wait about 2 to 3 seconds to simulate an automatic login.
* Choose a currency at the top right Currency menu.
* Key in the income for the month.
* Add expenditures for the month.
* See the calculation.
* Use the print button beside the dashboard heading to print it out.


## Future enhancements (for future hackathons)

Databases and a use of a proper secure framework for historical tracking.
More dashboards to track more financial stuff.
